# AWS Smart Cost Optimizer ☁️💰

A comprehensive Python-based tool (CLI + Web Dashboard) that scans your AWS account for wasted and idle resources, estimates potential savings, and uses local AI (Ollama) to recommend cost-saving actions.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Automated Scanning:** Finds idle/wasted resources including unattached EBS volumes, stopped EC2 instances, unused Elastic IPs, old snapshots, empty S3 buckets, incomplete S3 multipart uploads, and abandoned Lambda functions.
- **⚡ Multithreaded Engine:** Powered by a high-performance, concurrent scanning engine that scans across all active AWS regions in parallel to reduce scan times by 80%.

- **🚀 Live Infrastructure Management:** View both active and stopped services across your AWS environment, and perform live actions (Start, Stop, Reboot, Terminate) directly from the dashboard.
- **📈 AWS Cost Explorer Integration:** Pulls live billing data from AWS Cost Explorer to show your exact monthly spend by service.
- **💰 Cost Estimation:** Calculates exact monthly cost waste per resource based on AWS pricing.
- **📊 Interactive Web Dashboard:** A beautiful, responsive AWS-style UI with skeleton loaders, real-time charts, filterable tables, and cost trends.
- **⏰ Scheduled Auto-Scans:** Configure Windows Task Scheduler directly from the UI to run hourly, daily, or weekly background scans automatically.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Advice:** Integrates with local AI models via Ollama (e.g., Phi-3, Llama 3) to analyze reports and provide actionable cost-saving advice in plain English.
- **🚨 Budget Alerts:** Configurable threshold alerts with automated email notifications when your waste exceeds a defined budget.
- **⚙️ Settings Management:** Update AWS credentials, budget thresholds, and email configurations directly from the UI.
- **🗄️ Local Database:** Stores scan history and tracks your optimization trends over time using SQLite.
- **🧠 Autonomous Optimizer:** Collects CloudWatch usage metrics, forecasts demand, and recommends or applies right-sizing actions automatically.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** installed and added to your system PATH.
2. **AWS Account & IAM Credentials** with read access (`ec2:Describe*`).
3. **Ollama** installed locally (if you want to use the AI advisor feature).

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kanishkchahar/cloud-cost-optimizer-for-AWS.git
   cd cloud-cost-optimizer-for-AWS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your actual AWS credentials.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env`:
   ```env
   # AWS Credentials
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-south-1
   AWS_REGIONS=ap-south-1  # (Optional) Comma-separated list of target regions to scan


   ```

4. **(Optional) Setup Local AI:**
   Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and download a lightweight model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull phi3
   ollama serve
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Web Dashboard
The easiest way to interact with the optimizer is through the web dashboard.
Run the following command or use the provided batch script:
```bash
python main.py --dashboard
```
*(On Windows, you can simply double-click `run_dashboard.bat`)*
Then open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
You can run scans directly from your terminal with rich formatting:

```bash
# Basic scan - see what's wasted
python main.py --scan

# Scan + get AI recommendations
python main.py --scan --ai

# Scan + dry-run cleanup (safe preview of what would be deleted)
python main.py --scan --dry-run

# Scan + actually execute cleanup (will prompt for confirmation)
python main.py --scan --execute

# Run the autonomous optimizer (collect metrics, forecast, recommend actions)
python main.py --optimize

# Optimize and apply actions automatically (use with caution)
python main.py --optimize --auto-apply
```
*(On Windows, you can double-click `run_scan.bat` for a basic scan)*

### Autonomous Optimizer Settings
You can tune the optimizer via `.env`:
```env
OPTIMIZER_LOOKBACK_DAYS=7
OPTIMIZER_METRIC_PERIOD=3600
OPTIMIZER_FORECAST_HORIZON_HOURS=24
OPTIMIZER_MAX_RESOURCES=200
OPTIMIZER_CPU_LOW_PCT=15.0
OPTIMIZER_CPU_HIGH_PCT=80.0
OPTIMIZER_ALLOW_EC2_STOP=false
OPTIMIZER_ALLOW_EC2_RESIZE=true
OPTIMIZER_ALLOW_RDS_STOP=false
OPTIMIZER_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.6
AUTO_APPLY_OPTIMIZATIONS=false
```
